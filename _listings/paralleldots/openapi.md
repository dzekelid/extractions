        # Authentication
        What is the preferred way of using the API?

        An API key is required to be sent as a parameter to authenticate your requests.


        # Rate limit
        Is there a limit to the number of requests an user can send?

        There is no rate limit as such but too many concurrent requests will throw 504 time-out error from nginx.
